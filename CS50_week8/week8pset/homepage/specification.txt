HTML Tags Used:
1. <!DOCTYPE html> – Tells the browser that the document is HTML5.
2. <nav> – Used to create the navigation bar so users can move between pages easily.
3. <header> – Wraps the top section of the site, including the navbar.
4. <main> – Holds the main content for each page.
5. <footer> – Contains the copyright and social/contact links at the bottom.
6. <div> – A general-purpose container that I used throughout for layout and Bootstrap’s grid system.
7. <img> – Displays images like my profile photo, QR code, and project previews.
8. <p> – Used for paragraphs of text to describe myself and my projects.
9. <h1> to <h5> – Headings for page titles, section headers, and card titles.
10. <ul>/<li> – Used for quick fact lists on the About page.

CSS Properties Used:
1. font-family – To give text a consistent look (Times New Roman in the body).
2. color – To highlight elements, like links or icons, with different colors.
3. font-weight – To bold certain words (like “URI”) for emphasis.
4. max-width – To make sure images resize nicely on smaller screens.
5. display – To control layout, for example using flex to align navbar items.

JavaScript:
I used JavaScript to create a dark mode toggle that saves the user’s theme preference in localStorage so it stays consistent when the page is reloaded.

Bootstrap:
I used Bootstrap for the responsive grid, navbar, buttons, and icons, which made the site mobile-friendly and much easier to style without writing everything from scratch.
