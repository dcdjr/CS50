You would characterize their audio aura as somewhat above average energy, a moderate amount of valence, and an above average level of danceability as well. The way that I have calculated this aura might not be representative of the listener because it is taking the average of their top 100 songs, which is a big amount of songs. To get a more accurate aura, you may consider only calculating the average energy, valence, and danceability of say their top 20 or top 50 songs.
