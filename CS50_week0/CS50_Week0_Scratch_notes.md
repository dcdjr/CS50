# Catch the Beetle!

A simple but fun reaction game I built as my first project for **CS50 (Harvard’s Intro to Computer Science)**.  
The goal? Click the beetle as many times as you can in 45 seconds — sounds easy… until it starts moving faster!

## How It Works

- You’ve got 45 seconds on the clock
- Every time you click the beetle, your score goes up
- The beetle jumps to a random spot after each click
- Timer + score counter built in
- The game ends when time runs out — try to beat your high score!

## Why I Made It

This was my Week 0 project for CS50, built in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).  
It helped me practice basic CS concepts like:

- Conditionals
- Loops
- Variables
- Custom blocks (with inputs)
- Multiple sprites + UI

Currently working through CS50 and building my portfolio step-by-step.  

This is one of my first public projects!
